<h1>enfocus</h1>
<p>enfocus is a dom manipulation library for clojurescript.  
It was originally inspired by Christophe Grand's clojure based
enlive.</p>
<p>It supports all of the enlive based transformation along with many 
more transformation that are geared towards manipulating a live dom.  
The best way to understand what this library can do is to look at code.  
The animation that launched this site was created with enfocus through the
following code.</p>

<pre>
(em/deftemplate home "templates/home.html" [])

(em/defaction setup-pane [width height]
              ["#menu"] (em/delay 1000 (em/do->
                                         (em/set-style :display "inline")
                                         (em/fade-in 1000 20)))
              ["#content-pane"] (em/chain
                                  (em/resize 5 height 500 20)
                                  (em/resize width :curheight 500 20)
                                  (em/content (home))))
                                  
(defn init-content-pane []
    (let [size (dom/getViewportSize)
          width (- (.width size) 40)
          height (- (.height size) 70)]
      (setup-pane width height))))
